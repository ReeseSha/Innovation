             <h3>Negative Effects of WT2 Language Translator</h3>
             <div class="line"></div>
         <p>The negatives to this device is the price. The WT2 Language Translator costs 239.99$, which is double the amount of the Pulomi TT Easy Trans at 100$. It also requires a smartphone to be connected to the earpieces. The earpieces only work through the app, which requires an internet connection, to translate the language it is hearing. The translation is not perfect, which could cause some issues in some situations.
